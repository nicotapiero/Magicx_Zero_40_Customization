# Magicx Zero 40 Customization

Various overlays for the [Magicx Zero 40](https://shop.magicx.team/products/magicx-zero-40), inspired by the [GarlicOS_Customization](https://github.com/mugwomp93/GarlicOS_Customization/tree/main) repo

## Setting an Overlay
While running an emulator through Retroarch:
1. Press the "G" Button
2. Move from the "Main Menu" over to the "Settings" Menu by pressing right twice
3. Navigate from User Interface -> On-Screen Overlay -> Overlay Preset
4. Select the relevant `.cfg` file (the Android Downloads folder can be found under `/storage/emulated/0/Download`)

Personally, I like keeping the opacity very low (5-15%), otherwise it can get a bit distracting
