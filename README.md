# Magicx_Zero_40_Customization

based off https://github.com/mugwomp93/GarlicOS_Customization/tree/main pretty much

for bottom screen I like to keep opacity very low, like 5% honestly, otherwise it can get distracting

To set it:
G -> Settings -> User Interface -> On Screen Overlay -> Overlay Presets
(Downloads file is /storage/emulated/0/Download)

G button to close menu
